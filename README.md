MovieHub — Movie Rating & Official Streaming Links


MovieHub is a web application built with ASP .NET Core MVC that allows users to browse a movie catalog, add movies to personal lists (Watchlist, Watched, Favorites), rate movies, and write reviews.
Each movie page contains a “Watch Officially” section with links to legal streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix, MEGOGO, Prime Video), and the system redirects users to the selected provider.
Administrators and moderators manage the catalog, genres, and streaming links, and moderate user-generated reviews.
The system uses Entity Framework Core with a relational database (e.g., SQL Server) and ASP .NET Identity for authentication and role-based authorization, plus logging and automated tests.
